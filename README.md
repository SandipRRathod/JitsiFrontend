# Jitsi Meeting App&#x20;

## Overview

This is a web-based video conferencing application built with **Angular** for the frontend and **Java Spring Boot** for the backend. It leverages **Jitsi Meet** for handling video conferencing. The application allows users to:

* Start a new Jitsi meeting with a unique room ID
* Join the meeting within the same application using an embedded `iframe`
* View a responsive and attractive interface with Bootstrap
* Create new meetings using the Spring Boot backend integrated with the Jitsi server
* Connected to a self-hosted **Jitsi server on AWS EC2** instance

### 2. **Hero Section**

### 4. **Backend Integration (Spring Boot)**
